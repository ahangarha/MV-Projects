Contribution to this project is very much like contributing to any other Free/Libre and Open Source project. Just follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your fork on your system
3. Make a new branch from `develop` branch (This is important here! You need to checkout to `develop` branch and then make a branch)
4. Make the local development environment ready by running `npm install`.
5. To run the project on live server, run `npm run watch`.
6. Commit your changes.
7. Push your commits to your own fork
8. Send Pull Request from your new branch to this project's **develop branch**.

You are done. I will get notified and then take the next steps accordingly.

If later you need to contribute, you need to first make sure your fork is up to date. You should see a button on your fork for synchronization. After that, you need to use `git pull` on your clone (on you local machine) to get latest commits and then the rest is the same...
